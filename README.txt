Assumption:
I'm always assuming that we know the test data and all APIs responses.

Important Notes:
- TestCase1 Class is responsible to test when username does not exit
- TestCase2 Class is responsible to test end-to-end scenario
- TestCase3 Class is responsible to test when user does not have any posts
- TestCase4 Class is responsible to test when post does not have any comments
- TestCase5 Class is responsible to test end-to-end scenario and there are invalid emails
